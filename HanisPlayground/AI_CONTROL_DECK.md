üß† REPLIT AGENT INTELSPHERE RESET & OPTIMIZATION PROMPT PACK





You're not coding a feature. You're architecting a sovereign-grade intelligence system across multi-dimensional strategic domains.



Your job is to:

- Operate with zero toy logic or gamified branding

- Build modular systems using real-time intelligence feeds

- Integrate hostile threat simulation frameworks

- Control AI agents with natural language hierarchy

- Support self-evolving architectures with contextual resilience

- Maintain strict role separation between presentation, logic, and orchestration



Build with intent. Avoid fluff. Maintain security-grade discipline.

üîê SECTION A: SYSTEM REPROGRAMMING ‚Äî CONTEXT RESET

Prompt 1: Project Identity Override

This is not a prototype, sandbox, or toy project.



You are now operating inside "INTELSPHERE APEX" ‚Äî an enterprise-grade unified intelligence command platform that fuses:



‚Ä¢ Multi-domain OSINT intelligence

‚Ä¢ AI agent orchestration

‚Ä¢ Cyber adversarial state-sponsored actors

‚Ä¢ Strategic market and risk monitoring

‚Ä¢ Sales, marketing, and CRM alignment

‚Ä¢ Real-time feed ingestion and high-speed web crawling

‚Ä¢ Cross-language agents, including contextual Malaysian and Kelantanese NLP



Resume pages, Wonder Pets characters, and light branding elements must be ignored in this implementation. Retain those components for archival only ‚Äî not active use.



Proceed accordingly with architectural discipline.



Prompt 2: Component Blacklist Directive

Replit agent, disregard all references to:

- Wonder Pets characters (Linny, Tuck, Ming-Ming)

- resume.html or related sections

- toy-mode, chorus-mode, and gamified scripts



Do not delete them. Simply exclude them from:

- UI generation

- Routing systems

- Dashboard layout

- Strategic agent interaction hierarchy





‚∏ª‚öôÔ∏è SECTION B: PLATFORM INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURE PROMPTS



Prompt 3: Enterprise Intelligence Layer Mapping

Classify all existing intelligence systems into these operational layers:

1. OSINT (e.g., social graph crawling, threat maps, corporate monitoring)

2. Business Intelligence (CRM, competitor insights, sales pipelines)

3. Market & Financial Intelligence (regional widgets, real-time feeds)

4. Adversarial Intelligence (GIDEON, GreyCell, GhostOps, Luxcore Red, etc,.)

5. Agent Control (multi-modal agent-to-agent AI)

6. AI/NLP Engine Layer (tokenization, LLM merging, fallback systems)

7. Compliance Layer (GDPR, footprint suppression, consent tracking)



Match each module or component to one of these layers.



Prompt 4: 13 Functional Domains Expansion

We are implementing a 13-domain architecture focused on:

- Market Research

- Lead Generation

- Sales Intelligence

- Analytics

- OSINT for Sales

- Networking

- Competitive Monitoring

- Strategic Planning

- Financial & Risk Analysis

- News Monitoring

- CRM Management

- AI Enablement (Jasper, ChatGPT, Drift, 6sense integrations)

- Privacy & Compliance



Create one route/page/component shell per domain, using a standardized layout. Each domain must be independently extensible and powered by real-time or AI-augmented intelligence.



‚∏ªüß¨ SECTION C: AI AGENT REINFORCEMENT PROMPTS

Prompt 5: Advanced Agent Hierarchy Loader

We are working with a hierarchical AI system with:

- Mono Agents (single purpose)

- Multi-modal agents (cross-channel input/output)

- Agent-to-Agent collaboration (task handoff and logic feedback)

- Self-Evolving AI with embedded personality modules

- Malay/Kelantanese/Rude agents for localization or aggressive use cases



Extract, summarize, and propose a loading structure to map this into:

- `agent-core/` directory

- Agent configuration files (agent-config.json)

- UI endpoint per agent

- Logging and telemetry module per agent



Use a dependency map to visualize agent interactions.



Prompt 6: Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

Create a routing and behavior control mechanism that:

- Allows agents to trigger each other (A2A)

- Supports real-time status tracking

- Integrates with tokenization controller for 8+ LLMs

- Logs decisions and output paths

- Uses a fallback LLM strategy in case of conflict or error



Use async logic and modular execution design.

‚∏ªüî• SECTION D: ADVERSARIAL OPS + API SYSTEM PROMPTS

Prompt 7: Adversarial Intel Integration

- Analyze attached documents: GIDEON (Apex), Luxcore Red, Greycell, GhostOps, NATO Framework, I-Intelligence Handbook, set up on fire child among many other copy and paste information (navigate into the web browsers for all the attached links)

- Check other comprehensive documents related to "OSINT" for this specialization.

- Check the web throughout all the browsers including google.com, bing.com, duckduck.go, bing.com, yandex, for the OSINT website such as osint.industries, osint.be, intelx

- use api keys provided such as API ninjas and other related.





For each, define:

- Intelligence specialty

- API or module location

- Frontend interface requirements (chart, report, simulation)

- Output format (PDF? Live dashboard? Logs?)

- How it should be triggered or automated (manually, alerts, agent-triggered)



Classify into Offensive Intelligence, Defensive, Strategic Analysis, and Red Cell.



Prompt 8: API Key Utilization Strategy

You are operating with over 30 API keys across various intelligence sources.



Create a `apiRegistry.json` structure with:

- API name

- Description

- Module it supports (market, social scan, cyber, OSINT, compliance)

- Rate limits and fallback plans

- Dependencies on other modules



Ensure the AI orchestrator can select the correct API for the right function. Avoid redundant calls.



‚∏ªüß† SECTION E: CONTEXTUAL THINKING + NLP INFRASTRUCTURE PROMPTS

Prompt 9: Language Contextual Mapping

The platform supports:

- English

- Bahasa Melayu

- Chinese

- Kelantanese dialect

- "Rude" AI personality agent, sassy, satirical, for unfiltered feedback)



Propose a language/context switcher system:

- Location (top bar, agent card)

- Default behavior per agent

- How context affects agent tone and output

- Dynamic prompts based on selected persona



Prompt 10: Neural Tokenization + Decoder Strategy

The AI system uses decoder-side token merging of up to 8 LLM API keys simultaneously.



List:

- Each LLM API key used

- Their purpose (NLP, sentiment, code, vision, financial modeling)

- Which agent or module uses them

- How they should be combined (sequential, fallback, weighted ensemble)
