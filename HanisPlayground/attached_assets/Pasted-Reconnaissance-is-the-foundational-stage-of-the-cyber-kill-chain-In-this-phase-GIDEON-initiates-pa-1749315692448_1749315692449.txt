Reconnaissance is the foundational stage of the cyber kill chain. In this phase, GIDEON initiates passive and active intelligence-gathering operations to identify potential attack vectors, surface-level vulnerabilities, and organizational blind spots‚Äîwithout triggering early detection systems.

Powered by LLMs and adaptive intelligence models, the AETHER.SCAN module autonomously navigates open-source environments, deep/dark web indexes, and synthetic identities to replicate the behavior of real-world adversaries. It transforms fragmented, publicly available data into actionable threat models.
