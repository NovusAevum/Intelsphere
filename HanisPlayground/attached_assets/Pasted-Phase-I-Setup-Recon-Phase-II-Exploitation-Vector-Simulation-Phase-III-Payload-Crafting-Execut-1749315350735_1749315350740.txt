	•	Rebuild psychological profiles from digital exhaust (posts, sleep cycle metadata, device usage anomalies).

2. Neural Payload Crafting – AI-Driven Logic Bombs

Injected into cognitive workflows (e.g., dashboards, LLMs, NLP-based IDEs)

	•	Create adversarial prompts hidden inside documents, wikis, dashboards.
	•	Trigger LLMs to bypass logic checks, retrieve hidden data, or execute calls.

3. Truth Erasure Attacks – Weaponize Trust Systems
